          Hi, I'm Stock Sawasdee from Bangkok, Thailand. Currently I'm working
          as a full-stack software engineer in Tokyo. Before that I had been
          working as a research geophysicist at a national petroleum company for
          5 years. During my career as a geophysicist, I implemented many
          digital solutions mostly to help tge company find petroleum, and
          because of that I became facinated by the art and science of software
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, I got married to a Japanese wife, and we decided to move to
          Japan and live in Yokohama, my wife's hometown. At the same time, I
          decided to switch my career to become a professional software
          engineer. Though I'm working as a full-stack engineer implementing
          both, my interest lies in large-scale system designs and scientific
          computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I enjoy outdoor activities like running, cycling, and
          skiing (Fun fact: Japan is the{" "}
